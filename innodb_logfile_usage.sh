#     Title: Innodb Logfile Usage
#    Author: Juergen Hauser
#	 Email:	 hauser.j@gmail.com
#
#      Name: innodb_log_usage
#     File:  innodb_log_usage.sh
#   Created: August 08, 2012
#
#   Purpose: Log periodic deltas of the amount of bytes 
#			 written to the innodb_log_file per specified interval.
#
#	Requirements: bc (basic calculator, should be available on most distros), MySQL 5.x
#
#	Install: - make this script executable
#			 - add a cronjob, for example:
#			   */2 * * * * /bin/bash /path/to/innodb_log_usage.sh
#			   This will run this script every 2 minutes. You may want to 
#			   set this to a higher value, use common sense.
#			 
#	Usage:	 It's up to you to decide how long you want this script running,
#			 but the idea is to get an average value during your PEAK times. 
#			 If you don't know your peak times you can simply leave this script
#		 	 running for a day or two and use the average value as a starting point.
#
#			 To get the computed average value of MB/min written simply execute:
#			 /path/to/innodb_log_usage.sh compute
#			 
#			 This will add up the deltas of all samples and output the average.
#			 You can now use this average to calculate a reasonable value for your
#			 innodb_log_file_size. For starters, you could multiply the average times
#			 60, which will give you the size for an hour of logs, which is generally 
#			 plenty of data for InnoDB to work with. Be sure to round up your value for
#			 good measure and divide by two, cause there are two logfiles.
#
#	Example: After letting the script run during peak hours, I obtain the average value by 
#			 executing: /path/to/innodb_log_usage.sh compute
#			 The output: .61 MB/min; average based on 85 samples
#			 Using this number, .61, I now compute the amount written in 1 hour, so 
#			 0.61 * 60 = 36,6 MB/hour. For good measure, I round this up to 48MB, divide by 2,
#			 and set my innodb_log_file_size = 24M.
#
#	Note:	 To get the highest recorded sample value simply execute:
#			 /path/to/innodb_logfile_usage.sh highest
#
#	WARNING: You can't just change the innodb_log_file_size parameter in your my.cnf file and 
#			 restart MySQL. Doing so InnoDB will refuse to start because the existing log
#			 files don't match the configured size. 

#			 Be sure to shut down down cleanly and normally, and move away (don't delete) the
#			 log files, which are named ib_logfile0, ib_logfile1, and so on. Check your error 
#			 log to ensure there was no problem shutting down. Then restart the server and 
#			 watch the error log output carefully. You should see InnoDB print messages saying
#		 	 the log files don't exist. It will create new ones and then start.
#			 At this point you can verify that InnoDB is working, and then you can delete the old
#			 log files.
#
#			 The typical error message youâ€™ll see in the client when InnoDB has refused to start 
#			 due to log file size mismatch looks like this:
#			 ERROR 1033 (HY000): Incorrect information in file...
